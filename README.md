# SMTP


In this project I learned
	- How to read bulk files and use the data in my own script.
	- How to use SMTP python package to send email to multiple users(technically quantity of users is unlimited).
	- Uising MIMEText to encode email contents, like attachements, pictures, links, text, etc... .
	
		
This is a commandline application so you have to run it in a terminal window.

Steps for testing the app(after extracting the zip file):
	
	1. Update Email_List.csv file in the source folder and add email addresses that you want to recieve the email. Save the csv file.
	2. In the send_email.py file, update the sender's email credentials and name. Save the python script.
	3. Open a terminal a new terminal window and navigate to directory where the send_emails.py file exists.
	4. Run the command:
			python send_emails.py
	   Updates will displayed in console

	6. Check your inbox to see if you've recieevd the email.

I'm interested in knowing your idea about this piece of code so don't hesitate to contact me.
Thanks for using this script.
